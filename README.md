# Activities

- let's create a CRUD(CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DESTROY) functionallity (the project already have the "posts" table with just 3 columns (name, description, date))

- all the requests gonna be as JSON format using AJAX from the front end

- to add the value date in the column "date" of posts table you are gonna need to add a datepicker library https://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

- below the index table view of the posts you are gonna have a calendar (full-calendar) library showing the posts in the corresponding date of the calendar for example Post with id = 1 was set to date = 20/01/2020 in that day of the calendar you must show the record as item (please check the library documentation) https://fullcalendar.io/

- Add Bootstrap 3 or 4 for the front end https://getbootstrap.com/

- responsive design in all the views

- Pagination (Pagy gem) https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy

# Not need but would be nice to have

- rails conventions

- To use JS requests in Rails forms instead Ajax (rails conventions with differents format types)

- Instead to use a different views for show/edit, to use modals

- Pagination with JS

- To add seed file to create 500 records in the Database

- To add gems to use helper methods instead javascript libraries plain for example https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem , https://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap-datepicker-rails/versions/1.6.0.1?locale=es , https://github.com/bokmann/fullcalendar-rails
